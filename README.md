# mario-kart-simulation
# NP problem simulation

# This was a group project. Our goal was to simulate a mario kart track using with different parameters for each track. There are multiple shortcuts for each track.
# Our goal was to find the optimal path for each track. 

# I only completed the "Algorithms Analysis" file. and the diagram for the track
